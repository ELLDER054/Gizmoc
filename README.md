The Gizmo Programming Language.

# What Does Gizmo Do?
Gizmo is a general purpose language with C-like syntax but features dynamic lists, strings, classes, and much more!
Gizmo is compiled and written in c++, making it quite fast. Examples of things you could do go from guessing games to operating systems, even your own compiler!
